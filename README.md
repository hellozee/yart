# YART: Yet Another Ray Tracer

This is my 3rd attempt to write a ray tracer, I first tried with C, it got out of hand real quick then I tried with C++. It was sailing real smooth sailing with C++ but I got tangled in doing lot of other stuff like docs and tests.

Anyway, I wanted to pickup C#, it seems like a cool language, tooling is good, so wrote a raytracer in it anyway. Thanks to the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to get me up and runnning this quick, :D 

Enjoy the image, :D
